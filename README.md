# Day_Planner

The purpose of this application is to provide a digital day-schedule where the user can store notes, appointment reminders, and the like in 1-hour blocks starting at 9:00 AM local time and ending at 5:00 PM local time. Time-blocks will change color depending on whether the current time is before or after each block of time in the planner.
